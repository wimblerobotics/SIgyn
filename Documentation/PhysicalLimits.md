## Depths or widths of interesting objects
* Width of refrigerator: 36 inches or 90.1 cm.
* Depth from edge of freezer handle to front of refrigerator shelf: 15 inches or 30.8 cm.
* Depth of refrigerator shelf: 15 inches or 30.8 cm.

## Summary of interesting dimensions
* Robot width.

    A width of 18 inches will have a clearance of 7 inches (180mm)  or more (3.5 inches or 90mm) on each side, except for navigating between the bed in the master bedroom and the east wall, which will be tight.
* Arm range.

    The arm will need to reach from about 27 inches from the floor (70 cm) to reach down and hook the freezer handle (lower if attempting to grip the handle from below) to at least 62 inches (151 cm) to reach an object on the top shelf of the refrigerator.

This suggests that the top shelf of the robot, containing the elevator assembly, should be about 20 inches or so (50.1 cm) from the floor or a bit more. With the 48 inch elevator height, that will put the gripper horizontal arm somewhere near 68 inches above the ground. 

Consideration should be given to being able to tilt the horizontal gripper arm so that it can reach below 20 inches above 68 inches.

If the horizontal arm is made from an 18 inch drawer slide, which can open to nearly 36 inches, there should be good range to grab objects from the refrigerator shelves. At a minimum, a 15 inch drawer slide might suffice.
